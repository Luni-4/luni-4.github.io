title: "SchiacciaSette"

**SchiacciaSette**, in English **SmashSeven**, is an amateur game which is
typically played, especially during the Italian summer periods, in outdoor areas
such as beaches, mountain meadows, gardens, and even in shallow waters
near sea and lake shores.

To play this game, a light weight and aerodynamic ball is necessary. This kind
of ball allows any player to partecipate without great difficulty since it makes
passing and throwing actions much easier. It is good practice, when it is
possible, to inflate the ball before the beginning of a match.

SchiacciaSette's rules are quite simple.  
Players are standing in circle and **must** use only two of the six
volleyball skills to pass the ball to other players: *jump sets* and
*pass*.  
At the seven touch, the player with the ball **can** perform an **attack**,
renamed **smash** in this case, towards another player to eliminate that player
from the game.  
The winner is the last player when **all** other players have been eliminated.

The first touch of the sequence **must** be announced out loud yelling
the word: **One**. The player who forgets to pronounce that word is
automatically out of game.  
The following touches **must not** be announced out loud.  
When the sequence of touches is interrupted for whatever reason: the ball hits
a surface or it is intentionally stopped by a player, then the sequence **must**
start again from scratch.

If the player attacked by a smash is able to block the ball in some way,
the player who had performed the smash is eliminated.

When a player pronounces a number different from the word **One**
during the sequence of touches, that player is eliminated.

When the ball does not touch any body part, but any other kind of surface, if
requested by one of the players, the number associated to a failed touch
**must** be said out loud. If the correct number cannot be remembered, a player
is eliminated. But be careful, both the first and seventh
touch **must** never be declared out loud, otherwise, even in that case,
a player is eliminated.

This game requires **at least** two players in order to be played. There is not
any restriction about the maximum number of players. The more they are
involved, the longer a match will last.

Several variants of this game have been invented during the years and even I,
along with my friends, have drawn up a new set of rules which, on one hand it
enriches the game making the game funnier, while on the other hand, try to solve
some ambiguities to make it more accurate but without excessively increasing
its complexity.

# An innovative variant

This variant has been created to overcome some blind spots which
could lead to ambiguities or even cheating attitudes in the worst case.
The additional rules have been defined and improved starting from the
observations collected during various game matches played along the years.

Our own variant presents the following rules:

- You have more than one life, **at least** three. When the number of players is
  low, this rule lengthens considerably the duration of the game and at the same
  time makes the game funnier because you do not die at the first hit.

- When only two players are left, both of them are declared winners. This rule
  has been added because, over the time, the sequence of seven touches among
  two players had become very boring.
  Another possibility might be to reduce the sequence of touches from seven to
  five, or even three, but this option has never been seriously taken into
  consideration in our matches, although perfectly valid.

- You **should** not smash against the player who performs the sixth touch,
  called the __setter__, otherwise you lose one life. At first, this rule,
  already present in other variants, had been added as a metaphorical
  acknowledgment for a setter who lifts the ball,
  but over the time this rule has turned into a double-edged sword because
  setters started to physically throw themselves towards the seventh-touch
  players to make them lose one life. This rule though has been kept unchanged
  because it considerably enriches the game, forcing a player to decide,
  according to the context, whether to smash or otherwise drop the ball if a
  setter is going to act mischievously.

- A player **cannot** ask you the failed number **after** the beginning of your
  next action.

  If you decide to show the correct number with hands, without saying any word
  or else pronouncing a completely wrong number, you do not lose any life,
  because gestures supersede voice. At first, this rule seems really strange,
  but it has been added not to constantly stopping the conversations, since it
  this game has been used to socialize with other people as well.

- You can touch the ball more times without having to pass it to other players.
  This series of touches **always** counts as one touch. But be careful,
  you **cannot** perform this trick at the seventh touch, otherwise the
  sequence of touches is deemed invalid and you **must** start that again
  from scratch.  
  At the seventh touch, you **must** smash as soon as you get the ball.

- If you are playing in shallow waters nearby shores, you **cannot**
  immerse yourself into the water to avoid being hit, neither partially
  nor completely. You **cannot** even swim away. If you do not respect these
  rules, you lose one of your life as a penalty.  
  When you play in the water, you should stand on your feet
  as much as possible.  
  You can jump into the water to avoid the ball though.
