I am Michele (/miˈkɛːle/), nice to meet you all!

I am an Italian computer scientist, prevalently interested in multimedia topics,
but not only, indeed I really love embarking in any kind of cultural conversation.
Some themes? Arts, literature, religion, psychology, table games and many others.
As you will notice browsing my blog, a certain amount of posts would surely
tackle some of them.

I want to point out that I am not going to write posts one after the other,
but only when I have time or I feel the necessity to share my thoughts and
knowledge with a public audience.

Sometimes, I might also treat sensitive topics such as politic and religion, if
by any chance, you deem my way of writing not polite, please send me an
[email](mailto:luni-4@hotmail.it) to tell me what is the part you are not convinced of
and we can talk together about that.
Though, keep in mind that I will not change the content, just its form to make
it more objective. Indeed I think it is always right to express who you are
without offending the others, especially on Internet.

I have decided to build this site as static because I do not have time to answer
to possible, let's say improbable :smile:, replies in a serious way.
This virtual space has been conceived as a container for my thoughts.

Dear readers, sorry in advance for my linguistic mistakes which will be surely
present within my posts. If you want to notify me where errors are, helping me
to improve my writing skills, feel free to open pull requests
[here](https://github.com/Luni-4/luni-4.github.io). I would really appreciate
your effort, thank you!

## About me

**Luna** means **Moon** in Italian language. This word lead to the birth
of my nickname.

It all happened on a summer evening at my friend's house.
Full moon in the sky and sparkling stars above our heads. We were writing some
HTML/CSS files for a forum near by an opened window.
Out of the blue, someone from a chat started a call. We did not want to use our
names, so my friend proposed to use our nicknames. Unfortunately, I did not have
one in that period, so I went in thinking hat mode. Without even realizing, I
raised my eyes towards the sky and seen that beautiful full moon in front of me.
And in that precise moment, I chose my nickname: **Luni-4**.

**Luni** is a non-sense masculine plural noun for the word Luna. I have not
adopted the masculine singular noun, Luno, for a phonetic reason, it seemed too
unmelodic to my ears.  
The number **4** has always been my favorite number, I do not know why, perhaps
for its shape, or maybe because it is the first multiple of two.  
The hyphen was the most appealing way I found at that time to join together the
two parts.

This is how **Luni-4** was born.

For what concerns my skills as coder, I really love programming in the
multimedia field, particularly with videos, and you can find below a list of
tools and libraries I would like to implement:

- Audio and video format parsers
- Video compression codecs
- Inpainting algorithms
- AI neural networks to process audio and video
- GUI widgets, such as players, audio viewers, and subtitle table viewer to
visualize and interact more easily with this kind of data

Some of the points described above are still working in progress, but along the
course of time, I am sure I will develop some of them in Rust language to make
them real.
